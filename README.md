Assignment 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.

Write a JAVA program which asks the user to supply an alphabet in upper case from the key
board. Then convert the alphabet in lower case.

2.

Write a JAVA program to display the names of the Months of the year, depending upon the
number entered by the user using: (i) if – else (ii) switch – case

3. Read a positive integer value, and compute the following sequence: If the number is even,
halve it; if it's odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process until the value is 1, printing
out each value. Finally print out how many of these operations you performed. Write a JAVA
Program.
4.

Write a JAVA program to find the sum of the following series using
I. Sum = 1+ 5+10 +15+ ....+ n
II. Sum = 12 + 22+32 +

+n2

5. Write a JAVA program to simulate a calculator where the user enters two integer numbers
and an operator (+, -, *, /, %). The program then carries out the specified operation and
displays the result. Write using if statement as well as switch statement.
6. Write a JAVA program to display the table of a given number.
7.

Write a JAVA program to check for palindromes for Integers as well as string using( For
example 1221, 57866875 and avon sees nova are some palindromes):
(i)
if – else (ii) switch – case

8. Ten numbers are entered from the keyboard into an array. The number to be searched is entered
through the keyboard by the user. Write a program to find if the number to be searched is present
in the array and if it is present, display the number of times it appears in the array.
9. Ten numbers are entered from the keyboard into an array. Write a program to find out how many
of them are positive, how many are negative, how many are even and how many are odd.
10. Write a program to copy the contents of one array into another in the reverse order. The program
should take double type values from the keyboard.
11. WAP for 5 × 5 matrix (a) entered through the keyboard (b) initialized in the program and stored
in a 2-dimensional array mat[5][5]. Write a program to obtain the Determinant values of this
matrix.


12. Given two matrices A and B find its product using JAVA where A and B are Cartan matrices.
A Cartan matrix is a square integer matrix who elements ( Ai, j) satisfy the following conditions.
 Ai, j is an integer, one of belongs to {-3, -2, -1, 0, 2}.
 Ai, j = 2 the diagonal entries are all 2.
 Ai, j ≤0 off of the diagonal.
 Ai, j =0 iff Aj,i =0.

13. WAP to check whether given matrix is Upper Triangular or not.
14. WAP to find the maximum element of a given matrix.
15. Write and test the function that rotate 90 and 180 degrees clockwise a two dimensional square
array of integers.
